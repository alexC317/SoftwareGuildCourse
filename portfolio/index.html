    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

    <p>Hi! My name is Alex, I am an aspiring web developer born and raised in Queens, New York. Computers have long been an interest of mine; when I was in Kindergarten, I once asked a teacher when we were going to work with computers!</p>

    <p>My path to becoming a web developer began at the Bronx High School of Science, when I took a few programming classes, wanting to learn how to code. I grew quickly to appreciate Java and the concepts behind object-oriented programming. From there, I majored in Computer Science at Hunter College, receiving my Bachelor's Degree. Now I am currently enrolled in the Java-based Web Development course at the LaGuardia TechHire program!</p>

    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>

    <p>My past work experiences include working at the Columbia University Bookstore. I began as a bookseller, assisting students with finding their textbooks, and providing information about them. I answered phonecalls, worked with the Text-Aid system to look up book and course information. From there, I was promoted to the Trade department supervisor position. I was in charge of making sure the department was kept to standards, and making sure that projects were being worked on in a timely fashion. </P>

    <p>Finally, I was promoted to the Trade department Manager position. My responsibilities there included managing the staff in my department, placing book orders, arranging the floor displays to maximize sales, organizing events and logistics for these events (in and out of store), and implementing policies to make sure everything was running smoothly.</p>

    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
    <!--This could use  alittle more fleshing out! -->
    <p>My hobbies include a variety of topics! I enjoy playing video games, across a variety of platforms, having experience since I was little (games are a great deal as to why i want to work with computers and programming - I hope to make my own someday)! </p>

    <p>I have come to enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons over the past few years. The opportunities it provides for creating a cooperative narrative is second to none, both as a player and as a Dungeon Master. I am an avid follower of comic books as well; I may not read everything on the stands, but I try to keep up on major stories happening.</p>
